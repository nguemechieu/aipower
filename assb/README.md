## **Installation**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/assb.git
cd assb
```

### **Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Usage**

### **Run the Bot**
```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will start fetching market data, analyzing sentiment, and executing trades based on the configured strategy.

### **Command-Line Interface (Optional)**
If installed via `setup.py`, you can run the bot directly:
```bash
trading-bot
```

---

## **Configuration**

### **API Keys**
Ensure you set up your API keys for data fetching and trading:
1. Edit the `config.json` file:
   ```json
   {
       "api_key": "your-api-key-here",
       "api_secret": "your-api-secret-here"
   }
   ```

2. Save the file in the root directory.
